# SiliconLabs Open 3D Print Prototypes

## Introduction

This repository features designs for 3D-printed enclosures and specialized sensor housings/mountings, aimed at minimizing cluttered wiring and enhancing the overall aesthetic of hardware setups. Typically, these designs are tailored to integrate seamlessly with the virtual applications published in [application_examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/application_examples). However, they also serve as a versatile foundation for creating unique and innovative applications of your own.
